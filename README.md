# SCTP-NTU Cohort10 Group3 SRE Project

## Introduction

This repo is used host the code for final project of group 3.

## Usage

Before running this project, make sure you create a yaml file called secrets.yaml in database_cluster folder. This yaml should should contain the credential to access database.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysql-credentials
  namespace: database-cluster
type: Opaque
data:
  mysql-root-password:   # replace with your rootpassword
  mysql-password:   # replace with wpuser password
  mysql-replication-password:   # replace with database replicating  key
```

Fork the repoitory, run setup-observability.sh in to automate the provisioning of VPC, EKS cluster, monitoring setup.

The setup-observability.sh script is a complete infrastructure setup that includes:

- Phase 1: Terraform infrastructure
- Phase 2: Prometheus monitoring stack + Discord alerts
- Phase 3: MySQL HA database cluster (with replication)
- Phase 4: WordPress Application Setup (LoadBalancer service)
- Phase 5: Port forwarding for UI access

This provides end-to-end setup from infrastructure to applications in one script. The MySQL installation includes proper secret management and HA configuration.

## Service Status Checks

Refer to `SERVICE_CHECK_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive instructions on checking all running services and troubleshooting.

To trigger test alert with custom message - open new terminal, cd monitoring_cluster folder, run:
`curl -XPOST http://localhost:8082/api/v2/alerts -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @test-alert.json`

## Database Connection

MySQL Primary: `my-release-mysql-primary.database-cluster.svc.cluster.local:3306`

## Teardown

To completely destroy all infrastructure and applications:

```bash
./teardown.sh
```

This will:
- Stop all port forwards
- Delete all Kubernetes applications and namespaces
- Remove persistent volumes
- Destroy all Terraform infrastructure
- Clean up state files

**⚠️ Warning: This is irreversible and will delete all data!**
